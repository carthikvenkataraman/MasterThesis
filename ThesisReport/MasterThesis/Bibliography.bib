    abstract={A complete vehicle combination controller for enhancing the lateral stability of long heavy vehicle combinations by       active steering of the towed units is presented. As a case study, the controller is developed for a truck-dolly-semitrailer combination     and is evaluated in a sine with dwell maneuver, using a nonlinear model of this combination. The simulation results show a significant decrease in yaw rate rearward amplification and offtracking of the controlled vehicle. },
